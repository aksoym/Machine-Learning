# Machine Learning/Deep Learning repo of individual projects. 


## Fuel Flow Estimation of a Jet Aircraft with Deep Regression Model
[Go to Notebook](../AircraftFuelEstimation.ipynb)

This is a graduate level course project at ITU Aerospace Department. There is a lot of room improvement on the model and the result. This is considered a beginner project and not much effort has been given to it.


## Aircraft Existence Detection in Satellite Images with CNN
[Go to Notebook](../AircraftDetectionSatellite_wCNN.ipynb)

This is a graduate level course project at ITU Aerospace Department. The results are satisfactory as this is not a complex problem with a toy dataset. 


## Flight Phase Clustering(Extracting) with Autoencoder
[Go to Notebook](../FlightPhaseClustering_with_Autoencoder.ipynb)

This is a graduate level course project at ITU Aerospace Department. The results are satisfactory but there is room for model improvement. 


## Occupancy Detection in a Room Environment
[Go to Notebook](../OccupancyDetection.ipynb)

A beginner project with a toy dataset. Good for experimenting.
